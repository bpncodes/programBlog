question: "A prime is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than  and itself. Given a number, n, determine and print whether it's Prime or Not Prime.
Try to come up with a O(sqrt(n)) primality algorithm, or see what sort of optimizations you come up with for an O(n) algorithm Else Your algorithm might fail the running time requirements."
Note: "From HackerRank."

description: " Definition: A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. The first few prime numbers are {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, â€¦.}. And we know that if a number is even > 2 then that can't be a prime number so we have a condition for that. And the second optimization is that we run the program from 3 to square root of the number. Because after the square root the factors repeat in the opposite direction. Hence this method will optimize our code and reduce the time complexity drastically. "
